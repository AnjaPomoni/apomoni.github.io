My personal idea:

A refactoring of the already existing website.

---

## My idea
- I wanted to create a modern web site, with eye-catching colours
- I wanted to realize a place where clients could feel listened
- I wanted to make it clear how this business is
- I wanted to make it simple, but complete

---

## Structure of the web site
- **Chi siamo**: information about the business. Who really are they?
- **Prodotti**: a short explanation of their works, divided by type
- **Photo Gallery**: a series of picture of their past works. 
- **Contatti**: their telephone numbers, emails, social media... so that it is possible to ask for more information

## Design
- Clean and responsive layout 
- Single-page layout
- Intuitive navigation
- Clear and simple 

---

## what did I use
- HTML: used to structure the content of web pages, defining elements such as text, headings, images, links, and sections.

- CSS: used to define the visual appearance of the website, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

- JavaScript: used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the site, such as animations and hover effects.
